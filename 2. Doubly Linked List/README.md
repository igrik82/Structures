# Doubly Linked List

A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list. 
The structure is composed from a set of sequentially linked nodes, each containing references (pointers) to not only the next node but the previous one to. This structure is useful traverse the list both forwards and backwards, or quickly determine preceding and following elements from a given node.
