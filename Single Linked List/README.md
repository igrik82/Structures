#Single Linked List
1-way or singly linked list is the simple one in which there is one head node and other nodes are connected in forward manner. i.e, you cannot traverse backwards as there is no back pointer.
Linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next.
They can be used to implement several other common abstract data types - stacks, queues.
